What is "Refuctoring"?
===========

Take a look at these two videos.  Be warned, they might cause uncontrollable explosions of mirth.

The videos were an inspiration, a light shining into the dark places in my code.  I am in no way affiliated with the author of the videos, just a humble fan, and this *github* repo is homage.

Refuctoring by Example
===========

To follow the process of **refuctoring** the codebase, you will want to use *git* to checkout a series of tags.

- ```01-Start```
- ```02-Classes```
- ```03-Interface```
- ```04-Factory```
- ```05-First-external-library```
- ```06-Spring-support```
- ```07-Iterator```
- ```08-Spring-config```
- ```09-Spring-properties```

What's next for Refuctoring?
===========

The astute readers will have spotted additional refuctoring steps along the way, no doubt; this wasnt the only method of tackling the **pernicious** code-smell of "simple code".

Git provides a wonderful mechanism known as "the branch" however.

Other refuctorings are encouraged and will be incorporated as branches.  [Fork this repo](https://github.com/psh/Refuctoring/fork "Fork this repo"), branch from a given tag, keep tags along your branch as you are **refuctoring** and then submit a pull request.
